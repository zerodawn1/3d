you need blender 2.79b and the newest version of blender.

blender 2.79b:
	put the following folder mmd_tools in : Blender Foundation||blender-2.79b-windows64  
							/blender/2.79/scripts/addons
	
	open blender 2.79b File/User Preferences  add-ons look for mmd_tools and activate it.

	export the 3d model as fbx and open the fbx-file in the newest blender version.

	( you probably have to set the object material again)
